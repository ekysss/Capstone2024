- As part of Team Reporting, I would like to highlight Power BI mapping tool.
- Many datasets have location in cities or in coordinates. It might mean something to computers but to people it can be a jumble of numbers.
- Here, I will demonstrate how to build a map on PowerBI and put that information into perspective.

## Background
- The original data is about earthquakes in Indonesia from 2005-2023, comprising over 92,000 sets in 13 features. Indonesia is prone to tectonic activity because it's in the vicinity of the Ring of Fire in the Pacific Ocean.
  
## About Emily
- I studied Earth Sciences at Dalhousie a long time ago.
- I would like to merge my skills in the sciences with machine learning.

## Sample Data Selection
- I chose this data because it has coordinates in longitude and latitude format.
- Filtering magnitude in Richter scale and the count of the occurances in specific magnitude can show the places where there are more plate tectonic activties.
- The coordinates of the epicenter of the earthquakes can be visualized on maps.

## Technical Technique Demonstration
- The mapping tool is in Power BI.
- To demonstrate earthquake's epicenters can be mapped by occurrance, magitude and location.

## Implementation Plan
- Project is due April 15, 2023
- Use Power BI as the reporting tool.
- Create a video
