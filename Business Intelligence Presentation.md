# Earthquakes in Indonesia Presentation Proposal

## Introduction
- In this project I will apply Python and PowerBI to make the data about earthquakes that had occurred in Indonesia from 2018-2023 more comprehesible by mapping out the occurrances, seeing if there are more occurrances during the time of year or time of day.
