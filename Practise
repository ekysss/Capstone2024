# Building a Map Vsualization on PowerBI 

## Introduction
- I hope to demonstrate how to map earthquake occurrances in Indonesia.
- People can relate to coordinates if it is on a map.

## Background
- Many occurrances happen over time. It's nice to know where these occurrances are so we can either find the places to go to or to avoid them. In this case I would want to avoid earthquakes.


## About Emily
- I studied Earth Sciences at Dalhousie a long time ago.
- I would like to merge my skills in the sciences with machine learning.


## Sample Data Selection
- I chose this data because it has coordinates in longitude and latitude format.
- This data was collected in Indonesia from 2018-2023 of earthquakes occurrances and magnitude
- Mapping locations visualizes where the coordinates are.


## Technical Technique Demonstration
- The mapping tool is in Power BI.
- I hope to demonstrate of earthquake occurrance by magitude by location.

## Implementation Plan
- Project is due April 17, 2023
- Use Power BI as the reporting tool.
- Create a video

## Conclusion
- Using Power BI mapping tool to learn about mapping in my Reporting Team.
