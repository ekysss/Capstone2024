# Earthquakes in Indonesia Presentation Video


## Introduction
- In this project I will apply Python and PowerBI to make the data about earthquakes that had occurred in Indonesia from 2018-2023 more comprehesible by mapping out the occurrances, seeing if there are more occurrances during the time of year or time of day.

## About Emily
- Hello there! My is Emily Suen and I am a continuous learner.
- I am a mother of three, I've been a residential counsellor, and the Bagel Lady at the Pugwash Farmer's market
- I have completed B.Sc. in Earth Sciences from Dalhousie, Diploma in Business Administration from NSCC.
- I've gained some office experience working as the salt mine's office clerk.
- This year, I have discovered my passion of machine learning. I have applied knowledge of PowerBI, SQL, and Python which will be demonstrated while working on this project 

## This data:
- This data was chosen because it has time and location in latitude and longitude format which is needed to map out the earthquake occurrances.
- This data is from the BMKG, a non-departmental government agency in Indonesia.
- This data can be related to oceanic discoveries, seismic activities, health occurrances related by locations, or any occurrances with locations.

## Business Intelligence Techniques Demonstration
- Apply Python for EDA of the data
- Implement a Linear Regression Model on data
- Power BI to create the presentation
- Can I predict an earthquake?

## Implementation Plan
- Apply storytelling skills to make this interesting
- Create a video
- Due April 17, 2023

## Conclusion
- Find when earthquake occur and a safe place to go if I were to visit Indonesia.
- Not all earthquakes are destructive.
